2. **Predicate Required**: Yes, you'll need to identify a substantially equivalent predicate
3. **Timeline**: Typically 90-120 days for FDA review
4. **Key Requirements**:
   - Substantial equivalence demonstration
   - Performance testing data
   - Labeling review
   - Quality system requirements

Would you like me to help you find suitable predicate devices next?`;

**Top Predicate Candidates:**

1. **K123456 - Cardiac Monitor System**

   - Similar intended use
   - Cleared in 2023
   
2. **K789012 - Blood Pressure Monitor** 
   - 87% similarity match
   - Compatible technology
   - Recent clearance

3. **K345678 - Pulse Oximeter**
   - 82% similarity match
   - Similar patient population
   - Well-documented predicate

**Next Steps:**
1. Review detailed comparison for K123456
2. Analyze technological differences
3. Prepare substantial equivalence documentation

Which predicate would you like to analyze first?`;

- Target patient population defined: ‚úÖ
- Clinical conditions specified: ‚úÖ
- Contraindications listed: ‚úÖ
- Limitations addressed: ‚úÖ

**Recommendations:**
1. Consider adding specific age range if applicable
2. Ensure warnings are prominently displayed
3. Include reference to user manual for detailed instructions

**FDA Guidance Compliance:**
Your IFU meets the requirements outlined in:
- FDA Guidance Document: "Format for Traditional and Abbreviated 510(k)s"
- 21 CFR 807.92 requirements
